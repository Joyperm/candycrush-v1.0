## Overview
Candy Crush Version 1.0 is a simple, browser-based match-3 game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this version, the game allows players to match and crush 3 to 5 candies of the same type, while keeping track of the score. The game involves swapping candies on a grid, matching them in rows or columns to "crush" them and clear the board.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the game grid, score display, and buttons.
- **CSS**: Styling of the game elements, such as the grid, candies, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including handling user interactions, detecting matches, updating the score, and managing candy swaps.
